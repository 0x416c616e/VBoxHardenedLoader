Both loader and monitor driver projects support code signing.

To compile code signing friendly version use "ReleaseSigned" configuration.

The difference with "Release" configuration is in included Post Build Event for signing, additional linker option /INTEGRITYCHECK and identifier _SIGNED_BUILD is set which is controlling some code behavior in loader and driver.

Certificate for kernel mode code signing required.

To customize/configure code signing process go to Project Properties -> Build Events -> Post Build Event.

Example of code signing batch file
"signtool.exe" sign /sha1 CERTIFICATE_HASH /ac CERTIFICATE_PATH /ph /fd SHA256 /v /tr http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp %1

where %1 file to be signed


Warning

Use signed driver with signed loader and vise versa. 
Signed version of Tsugumi is incompatible with unsigned loader and TDL. 
Unsigned version of Tsugumi is incompatible with signed loader.

Using unsigned driver (loaded by TDL) in Windows 10 is unsafe because of Windows 10 TH2 Kernel Patch Protection (PatchGuard) improvements.
